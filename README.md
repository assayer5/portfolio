### [Data Accession via API](https://github.com/assayer5/VCF-annotation)

**Overview:** Parsed text of a VCF file to generate queries to a database API, annotated the file with data from API response, unit tested functions.

tags: pandas, API, requests, json, unit testing


### [Image Clustering](https://github.com/assayer5/pytorch-image-clustering)

**Overview:** Clustered images of numbers 5, 6, 8, and 9 from MNIST dataset. Tested two methods: feature extraction from pre-trained model, feature generation with autoencoders.

### [Multimodal single cell NGS data](https://github.com/assayer5/multimodal-single-cell)

**Overview:** Multimodal single cell NGS data (Multiome and CITE-seq) utilized for multioutput regression. For the CITE-seq dataset, scRNA-seq data is used to predict surface protein expression with ensemble model of boosted trees and regularized regression. For the Multiome dataset, ATAC-seq data is used to predict gene expression with a neural network.

tags: sparse data, anndata, ensemble learning, regression, xgboost, pytorch, neural network
