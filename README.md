## [Project 1: E. coli Promoter Sequence Classification](https://github.com/assayer5/ecolipromoter)

#### Overview
Classified E. coli sequences as promoter or non-promoter using k-mer counting and a naive bayes classifier on the UCI Machine Learning Repository: Molecular Biology (Promoter Gene Sequences) Data Set.
Final model scored a mean accuracy of 0.9125 with 5-fold cross validation and an accuracy of 0.9259 on the test set.

tags: classification, feature engineering, k-mer counting, confusion matrix, pandas, sklearn


## [Project 2: Microarray Leukemia Classification](https://github.com/assayer5/microarray-leukemia-classif)

#### Overview
Classified microarray samples as Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) or Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) using a support vector classifier (SVC) on a small subset of the normalized intensity values of 7,129 genes from microarray samples generated by Golub, et al.
Final model scored a mean accuracy of 0.95 with 5-fold cross validation on the training set and correctly classified all samples with an accuracy of 1 on the test set.

tags: classification, feature selection, correlation matrix, scipy, seaborn, pandas

#### Overview
Analysis of 2M+ Yelp users and 5M+ restaurant reviews to develop a data driven strategy to pick a delicious meal, applying VADER sentiment analysis and visualized with matplotlib, seaborn

tags: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy, nltk, sentiment analysis

## [Project 4: Housing Prices Regression](https://github.com/assayer5/kaggle-housing-prices)

#### Overview
Predicted housing prices using Ridge regression on the Ames, Iowa Housing Prices dataset available as [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques). Final model scored a mean RMSE 0.12132 with 10-fold cross validation and RMSE 0.12498 on the Kaggle test set.
