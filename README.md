## [Project 1: Microarray Leukemia Classification](https://github.com/assayer5/microarray-leukemia-classif)

#### Overview
Classified microarray samples as Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) or Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) using a support vector classifier (SVC) on a small subset of the normalized intensity values of 7,129 genes from microarray samples generated by Golub, et al.
Final model scored a mean accuracy of 0.95 with 5-fold cross validation on the training set and correctly classified all samples with an accuracy of 1 on the test set.

tags: classification, feature selection, correlation matrix, scipy, seaborn, pandas
